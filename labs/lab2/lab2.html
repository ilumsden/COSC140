<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 2 (150 pts: Fall 2017)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Want to play a game? In this lab you will have two programs
repeat the process of shuffling an endless deck of cards and 
dealing one until a desired card is reached.
The real point of the exercise, though, is to have you work with 
arrays and linked lists.
<p>

<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your TAs will tell you how to submit your work in lab. 
The due date for Prog2a is 11.59PM on Saturday September 16, 2017.
while Prog2b is due 11.59PM on Saturday September 23, 2017.
Thus, you have four days to finish Prog2a and seven days to
finish Prog2b. If working on a Saturday is a problem for you, 
finish the assignment on the Friday.

<p>

<h3>Dealing cards</h3>
You are given a code sketch for Part A of the assignment. This code
sketch
includes a near-empty main program that you fill in as well as two 
global arrays of strings representing the rank and suit of a card,
and a function for generating random cards. Carry this code over from
Part A to Part B. In fact, carry ALL the code from Part A
over to Part B and modify what's needed to meet the change in specs.
(The alternative is start over but that would be a waste of time.)

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs140/labs/lab2/copy to obtain
the following files: Prog2a.cpp (sketch code for Part A), 
prog2a, prog2b (Hydra solution executables), and a makefile.
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next. 
<p>

The two executables
take two optional arguments: -seed=N where N is
a non-negative integer for seeding the random number generator; 
and
-verbose causes the random_card() function to print each card to stdout
before returning it to the calling function. 
Note: That there is no error
checking on the command line arguments; if you feed the
programs garbage, they may crash or get stuck in a infinite loop -- you get
out of the latter by typing ctrl-C.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
For 50 points, make Prog2a.cpp compile and do the following.
Generate random cards until all the different face cards have 
been seen for
a given suit (i.e., "Jack", "Queen", and "King").
then print a table showing how many cards of each suit
and rank you were dealt along the way. Flag the suit that
caused termination by adding "**" at the end its output line.
<p>

The first step is to work out how to parse the string representing 
a card into suit and rank and translate those into the indices for 
the corresponding global string arrays. 
That is, reverse engineer what the random_card() function does.
Caveat: Do not simply use integer division to reverse the modulo 
arithmetic, instead use string comparisons.
Test the code by temporarily printing the suit and rank indices 
to stdout.
Break out of the loop after some small number of iterations.
<p>

The next step is to add a table that keeps track of which cards
you are dealt (counts of suit and rank pairs).
Implement this table using a static two-dimensional
whose content you initialize to zero before entering the while loop.
The table should have 4 rows and 13 columns corresponding to the
fixed number of suits and the number of ranks, respectively.
Test the code by printing the table to stdout as shown below
after you break out of the loop.
Again, do so after some small number of iterations.
<p>

The last step is to replace the finite-number-of-iterations 
termination criterion with the one requested which is based
on all face cards having been seen for a given suit. 
That is, step thru the table for each suit and set a Boolean
variable to true if the condition is met. Use this variable
to break out of the loop.
<p>

Test your Prog2a exectuable using different seed values. 
Use the verbose command-line option to print the cards to stdout
so you can double-check your table output.
When the code works as intended, clean it up and add a few comments.

<LI>
For 100 points, write the non-existent Prog2b.cpp code and have it
keep track of the order in which a card rank is observed for each
suit. You do this by inserting the cards at the back of
linked lists, using one list for each suit. 
The exception applies: each time a rank is seen again,
the card gets moved to the front of the list.
When the stopping criterion from Prog2a is encountered, break
the infinite-loop and print the contents of each linked
list to stdout as shown below.
<p>

Add an array of linked lists: the length of the array is fixed 
at 4 like before, while the length of each linked list varies 
from suit to suit. Each new card is added to
the appropriate list thru use of an insert() function. Declare
a list class based on a single linked list. The list class needs
to define a private node datatype, and it must include a 
constructor for 
properly initializing an empty list, a destructor for deallocating
all the nodes in a list as well as the list itself, and the mentioned
insert function which works as described next; no other list class
functions are needed.
Overload operator<<() used by ostream and have it print
the contents of the list. Since access is needed to private data
members, make the overloaded output operator a friend of the list
class. See the code handouts for how to set this up.
<p>

The list::insert() function is where the fun work takes place.
The function takes a single integer argument, namely, the
rank index of a card where index refers to the position of the
rank in the global rank string array. If the rank index is not
held by any node in the linked list, a new node is created and
added to the end of the list that stores the rank index value.
However, if a node is found to already hold the present
rank index argument, that node is moved to the front the linked
list. That is, the node in question is unlinked from where it
is and inserted after the head node. 
<p>

Hint: You are using a single linked list which means you cannot go
back once you have a match on the rank index. One option is to 
look ahead instead of advancing and then taking a look a the rank
index. Another option is to maintain two pointers, namely, one pointing
to previous node and one pointing to current node.
<p>

Hint: Write generic code that works under all circumstances rather
than have several codes for special cases. For example, write the
insert() function so that it can handle a rank match regardless of
where the matching node resides in the list. Draw a sketch of the 
different scenarios that need to be handled and infer from it how
to do it generically.

<p>
Try the above with the -verbose option on. Then try using a different seed.

<h3>Grade Rubric</h3>
<p>
NOTE 1: You must have a correctly functioning executable for each program you are assigned to 
write.
Verify your output against these working programs. The TAs will do the same when grading your
submissions.  According  to lab grading guidelines, approximately half of the points awarded 
for each assignment are determined by program <b>functionality</b>. Make sure your code does
what it is supposed to!

<p>
NOTE 2: Use any <b>naming conventions</b> described in the lab assignment. 

<p>
NOTE 3: Add comments that what purpose major variables serve (not loop counters etc) and 
what the computation is about at a fairly high level (not loop counter gets incremented etc). 
Less is often more. Write only as many comments as you think somebody would need to 
understand the flow of ethe code. You will not get points for comments, but you will loose
points if you don't have any.

<p>
NOTE 4: These notes will not be listed on future lab assignments but they will remain in effect.
